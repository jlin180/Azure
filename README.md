This app was targeted towards those who want to support those with mental health issues or those who want to seek help.
Our team created an Education tab which is used to educate the users on different kinds of mental health issues. We believe that in order for someone who support those who have mental health issues, they must first understand these issues.

The second tab which we created was the Self-Help tab. This was our main attraction during the hackathon. Self-Help allows the user to write how they are feeling at that moment. We used Microsoft Azure's Text Analytics to make sentiment analysis on the sentence(s) they write in that tab. This allows the app to rate the user's input from 0 to 1, how positive or negative they are feeling using AI, machine learning, and language processing. If the user's input is rated .5 or below, it will be considered negative and will trigger the next event purposed for those who are feeling negative emotions--giving them options or either seek help if they wish to speak to someone or ways to improve their mood. Similarly, if the user's input is rated above .5, it will trigger than event that allows the user to spread their happiness by connecting to a community for mental health or volunteering at such events.

Our final tab is the Connect tab, this is purposed for those who want to support those with mental health issues or be active in the mental health community as it displays different opportunities and places to reach out to show their support.
